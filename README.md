## Who am I?

I am a French-trained aerospace engineer currently pursuing a PhD in Civil Engineering at
The City College of New York. My academic background spans aerospace engineering,
numerical modeling, and remote sensing, which now informs my research in
atmospheric modeling and Earth observation.

## Research interests

My research focuses on the physical modeling of convective storms and short-term precipitation
nowcasting, with a particular emphasis on urban environments such as the New York City area.

I am interested in developing simplified yet physically grounded models that can be constrained
by observations and deployed efficiently for early warning systems.

Key topics include:
- Convective-scale atmospheric modeling
- Short-term (0–6 h) precipitation nowcasting
- Ensemble data assimilation
- Radar and satellite observations
- Urban flood early warning systems

## Current research

As part of my PhD, I am exploring **PDE-based frameworks** for convective storm modeling
(advection–reaction–diffusion), combined with **multi-source data assimilation** using
radar, satellite, and ground-based observations.

I am particularly interested in:
- Physics-based and reduced-order models for convection
- Ensemble-based data assimilation (e.g. EnKF)
- Hybrid physics–AI approaches to accelerate inference and forecasting
- Understanding scientific and operational bottlenecks in state-of-the-art systems

Systems such as **WoFS** have been a strong source of inspiration for my work, especially regarding
ensemble design and data assimilation strategies.

Earth observation, remote sensing, and environmental monitoring. Some selected outputs
are listed below.

- **Global Canopy Height Modeling (GCHM)**  
  Draft work on canopy height and biomass estimation using multi-source satellite data
  (Sentinel-2 and GEDI LiDAR), including model adaptation and large-scale inference pipelines.  
  *(draft / ongoing documentation)*

- **End-of-study internship report**  
  Research report focused on remote sensing and AI-based monitoring of urban and
  environmental systems.  
  *(PDF report)*

- **International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Milan – Poster (2024)**
