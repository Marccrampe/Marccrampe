## Research interests

My research focuses on the physical modeling of convective storms and short-term precipitation
nowcasting, with a particular emphasis on urban environments such as the New York City area.

I am interested in developing simplified yet physically grounded models that can be constrained
by observations and deployed efficiently for early warning systems.

Key topics include:
- Convective-scale atmospheric modeling
- Short-term (0–6 h) precipitation nowcasting
- Ensemble data assimilation
- Radar and satellite observations
- Urban flood early warning systems

## Current research

As part of my PhD, I am exploring **PDE-based frameworks** for convective storm modeling
(advection–reaction–diffusion), combined with **multi-source data assimilation** using
radar, satellite, and ground-based observations.

I am particularly interested in:
- Physics-based and reduced-order models for convection
- Ensemble-based data assimilation (e.g. EnKF)
- Hybrid physics–AI approaches to accelerate inference and forecasting
- Understanding scientific and operational bottlenecks in state-of-the-art systems

Systems such as **WoFS** have been a strong source of inspiration for my work, especially regarding
ensemble design and data assimilation strategies.
